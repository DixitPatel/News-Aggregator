Datsun Go launched at 3.12 lakhs

The Go measures 3,785 mm in length, 1,635 mm in width with a 2,450 mm wheelbase. The Go’s three-cylinder, 1,198 cc petrol engine delivers a peak power of 67 bhp at 5,000 rpm and a peak torque of 10 kgm at 4,000rpm. The ARAI certified fuel efficiency is 20.63 kmpl.
In the 80 years that Datsun sold beginning in 1914, 20 million cars were delivered. Datsun says one of the chief reasons for the revival was that the global sales share has moved from 40 percent to 60 percent in favour of emerging markets.
In the US car ownership ratio is 800 cars to 1,000 people, in Indonesia it is 75 cars to 1,000 people, while it is 15 cars to 1,000 people in India. The growth driver for the auto market in India is the purchasing power (GDP per capita – when it crosses 2,500 dollars, motorization starts, Datsun says). Replacement buyers mainly make up buyers in mature markets while in high growth markets it is mainly first time buyers.
This explains the 8K-9K US dollars transaction price in high growth market while it is 25k-30k US dollars in mature markets for a car. Datsun’s research shows that Indian customer wants a comfortable car for moving his family while one of the criteria was a car with modern design. The Go’s design pillars are its smooth silhouette, strong shoulder line, dynamism on the doors, Datsun officials say.
Connected seats (front), smart meter (fuel efficiency and fuel remaining indicator), auto speed control wipers, follow-me home headlamp and best-in class boot space are the feature highlights.
The Go will launch in four exterior colours and two interior colours. It will be retailed across 125 dealerships in India with a 2 year/unlimited kilometer warranty.
