Karbonn launches octa-core Titanium Octane and Octane Plus running KitKat for Rs 14,490, Rs 17,990

Joining the octa-core brigade, Karbonn has launched two smartphones using MediaTek’s low-cost octa-core chips. Dubbed the Titanium Octane and the Titanium Octane Plus, they are priced at Rs 14,490 and Rs 17,990 and like the Titanium Hexa, will be available in the first week of April.
While octa-core phones first showed up last year with the Samsung Galaxy S4, the Karbonn Octane twins have MediaTek’s MT6592 SoCs with octa-core CPUs clocked at 1.7GHz. Other common specs include 3G support, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS with A-GPS. Both the Octane phones run Android 4.4 KitKat and are more than well-equipped to handle the OS.
The lower-end Titanium Octane has a 5-inch 720p display and features 1GB of RAM, along with 16GB of internal storage. It also has a microSD card slot that can take in cards up to 32GB in capacity. In terms of the cameras, there’s a 13-megapixel rear camera and 5-megapixel front camera. Once again, Karbonn has skimped on the battery with just a 2,000mAh unit inside the Titanium Octane. You might need to carry a portable battery charger to last the whole day.
The Titanium Octane Plus, is clearly the more high-end since it has a 5-inch display with a higher resolution 1080p display. It also gets double the RAM at 2GB along with the same 16GB of internal storage. In terms of camera, the Octane Plus matches up to the Canvas Knight and the Gionee Elife E7 which both also have a 16-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel front camera. Disappointingly, Karbonnh as retained a 2,000mAh battery for the Octane Plus too, which is likely to have worse battery life thanks to the full HD display.
