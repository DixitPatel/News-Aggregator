Intex Cloud X1+ and Cloud Y11 smartphones offer outdated specs at affordable prices

Intex has gone entry-level once again, and launched the Cloud X1+ and Cloud Y11 smartphones in India which can yours for Rs 2,990 and Rs 4,490, respectively. One would have thought the death of Android Gingerbread to have occurred long ago, but one of these two new handsets has surprisingly managed to offer the said OS.
We’re talking about the Intex Cloud X1+ here. This ultra-affordable smartphone features specifications that justify its price. Running the Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread OS, it proffers a 1GHz single core processor and 128MB worth of RAM. Furthermore, just 256MB of internal storage is on offer, but there’s a microSD card slot for further expansions.
