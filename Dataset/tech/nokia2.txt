Second quarter India launch planned for Nokia X+ and XL Android devices

Finnish handset maker Nokia has said that it will roll out two new Android-based devices X+ and XL in the second quarter (April-June) of this year.
“We will come out with X+ and XL in the second quarter,” company’s Director-North, Ravi Kunwar said.
Nokia had announced three devices based on the open Android platform-X, X+ and XL-at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, priced between 89 euros and 109 euros. In India, the Nokia X, has been launched at a price of Rs 8,599. As we saw in our encounter with the Nokia X, it’s an odd phone and the initial impression it left on us was not very good. But we will have to wait and see how Nokia tunes up the X series.
Stating that India is world’s third-largest market for smartphones, he said that the market size for affordable range of smart phones would grow rapidly in the country.
“The market for smart phones in the range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000 will grow very fast in the country,” he said.
“India is one of the fastest growing markets for smart phones in the world. With the launch of Nokia X, we are adding more ammunition to our smartphone portfolio. We believe Nokia X is a unique combination of Nokia quality and experiences, Microsoft services and Android apps,” he said.
