Scientists discover melanoma gene fault

Australian scientists have discovered a gene fault that causes skin cancer in some families.
Professor Nick Hayward is part of an international team that found people with the POT1 gene mutation are at extremely high risk of developing melanoma.
He says the finding adds to growing knowledge about the genetic links to melanoma and could help identify which people should have regular screening.
Carriers should also be extra careful about their sun exposure to minimise their likelihood of developing the cancer.
