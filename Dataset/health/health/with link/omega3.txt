Vitamin E can be bad for you!

Vitamin-E-benefitsWe all know that antioxidants are supposed to prevent DNA damage. But employing antioxidants could backfire – at least in the case of omega 6 fatty acid that have been found to promotes cancer in animal studies. In their study, researchers found that vitamin E actually increased specific damage linked to omega 6 fatty acids. Know the risk of prostrate cancer linked with vitamin E. 
The vitamin promoted the formation of an ‘adduct’, a structure that links a chemical to DNA and which may cause mutations, said researchers from Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. On the other hand, in the setting of omega 6, the antioxidant green tea polyphenol reduced formation of another commonly found ‘adduct’ from omega-6 fatty acid – suggesting it may have beneficial health effects.
‘The third antioxidant tested, alpha-lipoic acid – found in spinach and broccoli and proven to have anti-cancer properties – had no effect on either of the two ‘adducts’ studied,’ said Fung-Lung Chung, a professor of oncology at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. Read why eating spinach is good. 
The study was designed to understand why omega 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids – found in many cooking oils – promote liver cancer, while their cousin, omega 3, helps prevent cancer. Researchers examined formation of DNA-damaging adducts in liver cells treated with omega 6. One of those adducts, Y-OHPdG, is well known, but the research team discovered a second one – DHHedA.
