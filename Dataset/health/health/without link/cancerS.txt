A revolutionary blood test to detect lung cancer and others. This is what have set up scientists from the Stanford University School of Medicine, who have devised an ultra-sensitive method for finding DNA from cancer tumors in the bloodstream. Previous methods had not sufficient coverage for the detection of a wide range of cancers, while the new test identified half of patients with stage 1 lung cancer and all patients with stage 2 or higher diseases. Moreover, ctDNA levels (circulating tumor DNA) allowed for earlier response assessment than radiographic approaches. Experts claim, then, that such new technique could apply clinically to detect and monitor diverse malignancies.
