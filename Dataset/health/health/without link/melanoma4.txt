A group of researchers from Washington have identified the gene mutation that leads to melanoma, that is, skin cancer. In a study conducted at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the lead researcher Dr David Adams told that a mutation in the gene called POT1 causes skin cancer. The mutation deactivates the gene that prevents the chromosomes from getting damaged. The deactivated gene further leads to longer regions of susceptibly unsafe telomeres that usually protect the chromosome endings. Such a mutation is hereditary in character and therefore this type of cancer can be inherited from one's parents or grandparents. Dr Adams further explained that now they would concentrate on finding out who is at risk of getting this kind cancer based on family history. His team also added that such hereditary mutations could be cause of many such cancers such as leukemia and brain tumours. The research group is about to conduct research towards finding ways to change telomere metabolism by inducing mice with inactive POT1 genes. - See more at: http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Researchers-find-gene-mutation-responsible-for-skin-cancer-1396260170/#sthash.rQ7d0moo.dpuf
