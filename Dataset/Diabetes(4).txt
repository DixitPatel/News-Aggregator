Diabetes cure could lie in intestines: Study

In a good news for millions of people suffering from diabetes, a new study has found that intestinal cells could be used to produce functional insulin-producing cells.

The destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas is the primary reason behind type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

"We are looking for ways to make new beta cells for these patients to one day replace daily insulin injections," said Ben Stanger, an assistant professor at University of Pennsylvania.

One way to treat type 1 diabetes is by transplanting islet cells to restore normal blood sugar levels and studies are on to find out that whether stem cells can also be used to create beta cells.

"Our results demonstrate that the intestine could be an accessible and abundant source of functional insulin-producing cells," Stanger noted.

In the new research, Stanger and his team introduced the three beta-cell reprogramming factors Pdx1 (P), MafA (M) and Ngn3 (N) - collectively called PMN - into the acinar cells of the pancreas and found that it made the cells to take on some structural and physiological features of beta cells.

The researchers then expressed PMN in a wide spectrum of tissues mice.

Three days later, they found that the mice died of hypoglycemia. "In tracking down which cell type it was, we saw transient expression of the three factors in crypt cells of the intestine near the pancreas," Stanger explained.

"Our ultimate goal is to obtain epithelial cells from diabetes patients who have had endoscopies, expand these cells, add PMN to them to make beta-like cells, and then give them back to the patient as an alternate therapy," Stanger added. - See more at: http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Diabetes-cure-could-lie-in-intestines--Study-1394694624/#sthash.x7LONuTB.dpuf
